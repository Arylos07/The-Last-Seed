# The-Last-Seed
Cancelled platformer project for Loot Tech Studios

I was later taken on by the indie studio Loot Tech Studios as a programmer and designer for their side-scrolling platformer The Last Seed. The project was to be an Android platformer that plays in 2D, but with 3D assets like Super Mario Bros. Wii. Due to loss of communication and many of the team members requiring to work on other projects, the project was later cancelled and no further communication has taken place since June 2017. The AI movement was moved into Don’t Die! and the player controller was modified and added to Don’t Die! as well.

No build is available, but the project source is available for review and testing. This version was originally made in Unity 5.5.0f3, however it should be able to be opened in Unity 2017.2 (untested with 2017.3).
